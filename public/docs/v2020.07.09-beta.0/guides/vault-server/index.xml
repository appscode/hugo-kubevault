External Vault Server In this tutorial, we are going to demonstrate how the KubeVault operator works with external Vault servers (i.e. not provisioned by the KubeVault operator). To do so, we need to configure both the cluster and the Vault server. Later we will create a Vault policy using VaultPolicy CRD in Vault to check whether it is working or not.
Before you begin Install KubeVault operator in your cluster following the steps here.</description></item><item><title>Vault Server</title><link>https://kubevault.com/docs/v2020.07.09-beta.0/guides/vault-server/vault-server/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubevault.com/docs/v2020.07.09-beta.0/guides/vault-server/vault-server/</guid><description>New to KubeVault?

Vault Server You can easily deploy and manage HashiCorp Vault in the Kubernetes cluster using KubeVault operator. In this tutorial, we are going to deploy Vault on the Kubernetes cluster using KubeVault operator.
Before you begin Install KubeVault operator in your cluster following the steps here. To keep things isolated, we are going to use a separate namespace called demo throughout this tutorial.</description></item><item><title>Vault Server Overview</title><link>https://kubevault.com/docs/v2020.07.09-beta.0/guides/vault-server/overview/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubevault.com/docs/v2020.07.09-beta.0/guides/vault-server/overview/</guid><description>New to KubeVault?

Overview The KubeVault operator makes it easy to deploy, maintain and manage Vault servers in Kubernetes clusters. It covers automatic initialization and unsealing and also stores unseal keys and root token in a secure way. The KubeVault operator can manage policies and secret engines of Vault servers which are not provisioned by the KubeVault operator. It has the following features:
Vault Policy Management: Provides a Kubernetes native way to manage Vault policies and bind those policies to the users or the auth method roles.</description></item></channel></rss>
